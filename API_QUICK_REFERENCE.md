## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Considerations:**

1. **Passwords**: Currently stored in plain text. Implement bcrypt hashing!
2. **Authentication**: Add JWT tokens for session management
3. **Validation**: Add input validation middleware (Joi/Yup)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement to prevent abuse
5. **CORS**: Configure properly for frontend integration
6. **HTTPS**: Use SSL/TLS in production
